# Cost Accounting Analysis & Budgeting for AMC

## Project Overview

This case study analyzes the costs associated with manufacturing a **machined aluminum bracket** at the Advanced Manufacturing Center (AMC). AMC, affiliated with EIU and invested by Becamex IDC, serves as a modern facility bridging academia and industry, particularly supporting SMEs and start-ups in Binh Duong.

The project aims to:

1.  Identify and calculate all relevant manufacturing costs (Direct Materials, Direct Labor, Manufacturing Overhead) for producing the aluminum bracket.

2.  Utilize appropriate costing methodologies (primarily Job-Order Costing, potentially supplemented by Activity-Based Costing).

3.  Reconstruct the quotation price provided by AMC based on calculated costs and assumed markups.

4.  Develop a basic production budget (Sales, Production, Direct Materials, Direct Labor, Manufacturing Overhead, COGM, Projected Income Statement) for a hypothetical order.

5.  Provide recommendations for cost reduction and efficiency improvements at AMC.

## Key Areas of Analysis

The analysis covers:

**Company & Product Overview:** Profile of AMC and detailed specifications of the aluminum bracket.

**Costing Methodology:** Justification for using Job-Order Costing and description of data collection methods and key assumptions (e.g., OEE at 65%, depreciation methods, scrap rates, labor rates).

**Cost Components Breakdown:** Detailed calculation of:
    
Direct Materials (including adjustments for defects, scrap value).
    
Direct Labor (based on hourly wages and estimated production time).
    
Manufacturing Overhead (Fixed: depreciation of machinery, tools, jigs; Variable: electricity, measuring labor, outsourced anodizing, packaging, transport).

**Cost Calculation & Quotation:** Summarized cost per unit and calculation of the final quotation price based on cost inputs and markup percentages (Manufacturing Expenses 90%, Fixed Factory Expenses 5%, Profit 5%).

**Budgeting Analysis:** Preparation of linked budgets for a 1000-unit order, including Sales, Production, DM, DL, MOH, COGM, and a Projected Income Statement.

**Recommendations:** Strategies for cost reduction (targeting machine depreciation, setup time, defect rates, anodizing) and efficiency improvements (optimizing OEE, streamlining measurement, parallel processing).
